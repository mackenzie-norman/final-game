\title{The life and times of Michael K.}
\author{Mackenzie Norman}
\begin{document}
\maketitle
This game came to me as I was writing my keyword project. I think the life and times of Michael K. is one of the more transformative books I have had the privilege of reading. I felt the same way as when I read The Vegetarian (which is very high praise).
K. wants solely to be a gardener so I thought it would be kind to make a game in which you can do that. I think Michael's hunger is one of the more interesting part of the story and so I struggled to add it to the game. Initially I added a variable \mintinline{rust}|hunger| so that the game could track the hunger of Michael, and this is how you would lose (death being loss). But as I went on, I thought about how Michael did not seem to get hungry when he was gardening ``No man can survive on just pumpkins'' but Michael does.
I think this Coetzee's response (?) to ideal of the ethical indian, K. takes the role of a machine, no longer human, simply waiting for his time to harvest.
